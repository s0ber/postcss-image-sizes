```css
img.my_image {
  /* Input example */
  background-size: image-width('~my_image.png') image-height('~my_image.png');
}

img.my_hidpi_image {
  /* Input example */
  background-size: hidpi-image-width('~my_image.png') hidpi-image-height('~my_image.png');
}
```

```css
img.my_image {
  /* Output example */
  background-size: 100px 200px;
}

img.my_hidpi_image {
  /* Output example */
  background-size: 50px 100px;
}
```

## Usage

```js
const imageSizes = require('postcss-image-sizes')
postcss([imageSizes({assetsPath: '/path/to/images'})])
```

See [PostCSS] docs for examples for your environment.

## Absolute and relative paths

We recommend to use absolute paths for images, since CSS has very limited support for relative paths. Path is treated as absolute, when it is prefixed with `~` or `/` sign. You need to specify `assetsPath` option to use those absolute paths (see below).

All other paths will be treated as relative (to current file).

## Configuration options

`assetsPath` â€” absolute path, against which images paths will be resolved.
